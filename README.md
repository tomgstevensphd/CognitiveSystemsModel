# CognitiveSystemsModel
CogSys is an in-progress experimental model of human cognitive functioning. One practical part is an modified implementation of George Kelly's Role RepTest questionnaire for identifiying important cognitive categories as part of my CSQ-Cognitive Systems Questionnaire.
Written entirely with ListWorks Common Lisp using LW's CAPI for graphical interfaces.
Check the config files for additional file that must be loaded to run these programs. 
Start with CSQ-manage.lisp to run the Cognitive Systems Questionnaire--which should function properly including the first main part that uses a variation of George Kelly's Role Reptest.  Eg "What is an important way that 2 of the 3 following items are ALIKE and DIFFERENT from the 3rd."
Later it also asks users to rate the value of each "Personal Construct" or cognitive category that they have previously listed.

At this time the CSQ functions properly. You must however have LispWorks to run CAPI.  A personal version can be downloaded free from lispworks.com.
